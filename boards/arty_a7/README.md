TinyDFU for the Arty-A7
=======================
This port allows the DFU bootloader to operate on a Digilent Arty-A7 board
when outfitted with a USB port via one of its PMOD headers. The following
pins are used by the bootloader:

| Port   | Function                         |
|:-------|:---------------------------------|
| JA7    | USB Pullup resistor (1.5k to D+) |
| JA9    | USB D+                           |
| JA10   | USB D-                           |
| BTN0   | Boot mode select                 |
| LED4-7 | Boot status                      |

At power-on, the `BTN0` is checked to see if the board should remain in
bootloader mode, or if the board should boot into the user image after a
short timeout.

Building
========
A `Makefile` has been provided that allows you to build and program the DFU
bootloader. It supports the following make targets:

| Target         | Description                                                 |
|:---------------|:------------------------------------------------------------|
| `arty-a7-35t`  | Build the bootloader bitstream for an Arty-A7-35 (default). |
| `arty-a7-100t` | Build the bootloader bitstream for an Arty-A7-100.          |
| `prog`         | Program the bootloader into the FPGA using OpenOCD.         |
| `dfu`          | Program the bootloader into the flash using dfu-util.       |
| `clean`        | Delete any files generated by Vivado.                       |
